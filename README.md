# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Xiaoxi Zhang**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- I didn't finished the default tip percentage part. I have saw some vedios teaching on how to pass data from one View Controller to another and how to save data, setting, and perference. I think I'm using the right way to do the coding but I don't know why it didn't work. I want to learn more on Swift to improve it.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Before worked on this pre-homework, I haven't done anything with Swift or objective C. The video walkthrough was very helpful for the main View Controller of the Tip Calculator however it was not easy for me to do the setting View Controller. It took me a while to figure out how to use the Navigation Controller. After seen some tutorial videos, I learnd some codes on how to pass data from View Controller and how to save data, setting, and perference, but I still couldn't use them well.
All in all, it was challenging and interesting. I want to learn more on Swift.
